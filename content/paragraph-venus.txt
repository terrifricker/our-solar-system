Venus, the 2nd closest planet to the sun, is also a terrestial planet with a metal core surrounded by rock.  Its size, mass, and density are the very similar to the earth’s.  Venus’s year is 225 earth days as it is closer to the sun.  Its rotation is very unusual.  Most planets and the sun spin counter-clockwise when viewed from above the north pole.  Venus spins the opposite direction, clockwise, extremely slowly.  It spins orders of magnitude more slowly than the other planets, taking 243 earth days.  It takes Venus more time to spin once around its axis than it takes to make one full orbit.
