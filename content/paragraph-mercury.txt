Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. It is small and dense with an iron core covered by a rocky shell.  Compared to the earth, Mercury orbits the sun very quickly, but rotates slowly. It has the shortest year of all the planets, taking only 88 earth days to orbit around the sun, but taking 59 earth days to completely rotate on its axis.  Once the sun starts shining at a location on Mercury, the sun doesn’t go down until 176 earth days has passed.  Mercury is also very close to the sun, so the surface gets very hot as it faces the sun for so long, as hot as 800F.  At the same time, the other side faces away from the sun and doesn’t get any solar radiation for 176 earth days making that side very cold, -300F.
